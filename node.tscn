text = "You are Gablo, he is a blue critter dude. His job is to keep the earth spinning. After working for 3700 years 
consecutively Gablo is tired and wants to take his two sick days provided by his company every 100 years. 
His boss is not happy to find Gablo chilling in the Bahamas instead of 
being at work to keep the earth spinning on the y axis. Without him keeping the flat earth spinning reality 
begins to crumble. The boss gives Gablo two days to get back to work and if he can't make
 it back in time Gablo will be fired. Gablo hurries back to work but finds himself in a predicament. 
While Gablo ventures back to work he meets his perfect girl Mimzy. 
She is a lazy, laid back loser. But despite this Gablo is envious of her low intensity laid back life, compared to 
his high intensity high stress life. Gablo must decide what is more important, saving the world or being happy.
